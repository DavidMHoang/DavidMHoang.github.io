---

I’m transitioning deeper into security engineering. I come from a developer background, so my default approach is: understand the system, map the risk, then make changes that are realistic for engineers to ship.

<div class="hr"></div>

## What I care about

- Clear, actionable security guidance
- Security that scales with cloud complexity
- Writing things down to reinforce understanding
- Documentation that I can reuse later.

## What I'm working on right now

- Building stronger cloud security fundamentals (IAM, secrets, boundaries)
- Developing a risk-oriented security mindset
- Practicing web application testing and documenting findings
