title: "Why I Reworked This Site (and Why This Blog Exists)"
description: "Why I rebuilt my portfolio as I transition deeper into security engineering, and what I plan to use this blog for."
---

I recently reworked this site — not because the old one was broken, but because it no longer reflected where I am or where I’m going.

As I transition deeper into security engineering, especially around **application security and cloud security**, I realized I needed a place that clearly communicates how I think, not just what tools I’ve touched.

This site isn’t meant to be flashy. It’s meant to be **honest, maintainable, and useful** — both to me and to anyone trying to understand how I approach security.

## Why rebuild the site?

My earlier portfolio focused more on _outputs_: pages, features, and surface-level projects. That made sense at the time — I was coming from a web developer background and optimizing for visibility.

As I’ve moved toward security engineering, my priorities have shifted:

- Understanding systems before applying controls
- Thinking in terms of **risk, tradeoffs, and failure modes**
- Communicating findings in a way engineers can action on
- Building small habits around documenting what I learn

The old site didn’t leave room for that. This one allows for me to scale.

## Why keep it simple?

I deliberately rebuilt this site using **GitHub Pages and Jekyll** with minimal tooling. That was a conscious decision.

Security work often benefits from simple, understandable systems. I wanted a setup that:

- Encourages writing instead of tinkering
- Will not negatively effect me if I leave it for some time
- Easy to read, understand, and navigate

The result is something low-maintenance that I can evolve over time without drawback.

## Why this blog exists

This blog isn’t meant to be a collection of polished tutorials or “expert takes.”

It’s a place to:

- Write down my continuous learning journey
- Document testing workflows and decision-making
- Capture _why_ something matters, not just _how_ to do it
- Reinforce my own understanding by explaining things clearly

Most posts will be short. Some may be rough. All of them are part of a new beginning, building depth instead of pretending I already have it.

## What to expect here

You’ll mostly see posts about:

- Cloud security fundamentals (IAM, boundaries, secrets)
- How small design decisions turn into real security outcomes
- Personal research about topics of interest in security or tech

If you’re also learning or transitioning into security engineering, my hope is that some of this thinking is useful.

For now, this site and this blog are works in progress.
