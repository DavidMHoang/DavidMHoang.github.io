I used to keep notes everywhere — random docs, half-finished checklists, “I swear I’ll remember this later.”

I won’t.

So this blog is my public notebook as I move deeper into security engineering, especially **application security** and **cloud security**. I’m not trying to sound like an expert. I’m trying to be precise about what I learned and what I’d do differently next time.

A few things I plan to write about:

- AppSec workflows that actually fit how dev teams work
- Cloud security fundamentals (IAM, secrets, segmentation) explained plainly
- Tools I’m learning (and where they helped vs where they didn’t)
- Mistakes, tradeoffs, and what I’d change on the second pass

If you stumble on this and something looks off, tell me. I’d rather correct a post than pretend I nailed it.
