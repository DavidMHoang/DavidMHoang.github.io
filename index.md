    <h1>Security Engineer | Application &amp; Cloud Security</h1>
    <p class="sub">
      I’m building toward security engineering roles that sit close to real systems: how apps are built, how they run in cloud environments,
      and how small design choices turn into big security outcomes.

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Application Security (practical)</h3>
        <p>Practicing application security by testing real workflows, identifying common failure modes, and learning how to communicate findings in a way developers can act on.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Cloud Security Foundations</h3>
        <p>Building a strong foundation in cloud security concepts such as identity, access boundaries, and secrets management, and learning how design choices affect risk as systems grow.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Security Engineering Approach</h3>
        <p>Approaching security by reasoning about risk, tradeoffs, and attack paths, rather than treating security as a set of tools or rules.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Web App Testing Notes</h3>
        <p>Practicing application security by testing common web workflows, documenting findings, and learning how to explain impact and remediation clearly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Vuln Scanning + Triage (OpenVAS)</h3>
        <p>Running vulnerability scans, reviewing results critically, and practicing how to separate noise from issues that matter in real environments.</p>

        If you’re hiring for security engineering roles (AppSec / CloudSec), or you want to compare notes on breaking into the field,
        send me a message. I read everything — might take a day to reply if I’m heads-down.
